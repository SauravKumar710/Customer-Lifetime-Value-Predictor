# CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE PREDICTOR  :chart:	
This project is a part of the SEMESTER 3 project at [Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore](https://vit.ac.in/).  

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Objective
The main goal of this project is to create Machine & Deep Learning models that can predict Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) by learning from previous data, and then select the most accurate model.


### The following methods were employed:
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Algorithms
* Multiclass Classification using Random Forest
* Deep Learning â€“ ANN
* Multiclass Classification using Logistic Regression

## Project Objective

* Obtaining dataset. 
* Identify the problem type.
* Brief analysis on the models to be used.
* Created a High Level Design & Use Case Design. 
* Building a Machine Learning Model that will predict CLV by learning from the previous data.
* Analysing the accuracy 
* Visualization of the dataset 
* Data set analysis 

We built various Machine & Deep Learning Models that will predict C.L.V by learning from the previous data. Moreover, choosing the most appropriate model based on its accuracy score.

## Needs of this project

To successfully carry out this project, we require the expertise of Frontend developers, Data exploration/descriptive statistics, Data processing/cleaning, Statistical modeling, and Writeup/reporting.
